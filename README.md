# Advent Of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), which occurs in December of each year as a festive-themed coding challenge.

## 2022

This is my first year participating in the Advent of Code challenge.
My intention is to complete all puzzles within the first 24 hours of their release.
I will use the Python programming language, with an emphasis on code quality.
